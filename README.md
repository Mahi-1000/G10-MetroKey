# G10-MetroKey
Executive summary
Being a citizen of a metro city, we usually face a lot of problems while travelling through metro. As cities continue to grow, public transportation systems become increasingly important, and the metro is no exception. However, with a high number of passengers using the metro, top-up machines can often become congested, causing long lines and inconvenience to passengers.

*Background*<'br'>
The existing technology used for  metro cards is Block chain includes  Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology that enables devices to establish communication by bringing them close together or in contact with each other.

Major pros of using our metro key technology are:
Convenience: Virtual metro cards eliminate the need for physical cards, making it easier for users to manage and access their fare information.
Cost-effective: There's no production or distribution cost associated with physical cards, reducing expenses for transport authorities.
Reduced fraud: Virtual cards can be securely linked to a user's account, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities like counterfeiting or theft.
Customization Virtual metro cards can be personalized with user-specific settings and preferences.
Contactless payments: NFC technology enables seamless contactless transactions, providing a hygienic and efficient experience.

Some drawbacks of our project metro key are:
Technology dependency: Virtual metro cards rely on NFC-enabled devices, which may exclude users with older or incompatible smartphones.
Power and network requirements: NFC technology requires power and a network connection, which can be a challenge in areas with limited infrastructure.
Potential security concerns: While efforts are made to secure virtual cards, there's always a risk of hacking or unauthorized access to personal and financial data.
User adoption: Some users may be hesitant to switch from traditional physical cards to virtual options due to familiarity or concerns about technology reliability.



*Proposed approaches*
Problem Identification:
The identification of the problem with top-up machines in the metro is related to the challenges caused by the high volume of passengers using them. 
•	These challenges include congestion, long lines, reduced efficiency, and slower service, which ultimately result in inconvenience for passengers.
•	The issue highlights the need for effective solutions to improve the top-up process and enhance the overall transportation experience for passengers.
This problem could be solved by using a metro card which can top up by the user’s device itself and does not require any top up machine. For that we are making a virtual metro card which works the same as our traditional metro card but more effectively and efficiently. To integrate with a metro card system, you would need permission and API access, identify the data exchange protocol, develop the interface, implement data storage and retrieval, and test and refine the integration.
